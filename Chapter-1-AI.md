Chapter 1: AI for My Future — Notes

What is AI?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) = computer systems that learn from past data & mistakes to make highly accurate predictions for future use.
AI uses algorithms — step-by-step instructions to solve problems.
Machines recognize patterns through repetitive processes using data as their training material.

Data — The Raw Material of AI
Data = fuel for AI.
Used to train models, recognize patterns, and make connections between behaviors, interests, or trends.

How AI Recognizes Patterns
Through pattern analysis: finding similarities in interest, behavior, or timing (like browsing habits).
Achieved mainly using Machine Learning (ML).

Machine Learning (ML)
Not all AI is ML, but all ML is AI.
ML = systems that learn from data, identify patterns, and use them to make predictions & decisions.
Improves via continuous learning & adaptation.

Types of ML:

Supervised Learning
Trained on labeled data (like having a coach who guides you).
Example: Email spam detection (spam or not spam).

Unsupervised Learning
Trained on unlabeled/raw data (learning without a coach).
Example: Grouping customers by purchasing habits.

Reinforcement Learning
Learns by interacting with the environment and receiving feedback (+ve or -ve).
Example: Teaching a robot to walk.

Deep Learning (DL)
A subset of ML that uses neural networks.
Enables computers to make complex decisions using large amounts of data.
Common in image recognition, speech recognition, etc.

Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Allows machines to process, interpret, and understand human language.
Used in chatbots, voice assistants, translation tools, etc.

Types of Algorithms in AI

-Regression
Used for prediction using data.
Example: Predicting house prices or sales trends.

-Clustering
Used to group similar data or interests together.
Example: Grouping customers by purchasing behavior.

-Optimization
Used to find the best or most efficient solution/path.
Example: Finding the shortest delivery route or best resource allocation.

-Classification
Used to sort data into defined categories.
Example: Email filtering (spam vs non-spam), disease detection.

Internet of Things (IoT)
IoT devices collect data from the environment.
This data can be used by AI systems to make smarter decisions or automate tasks.
Example: Smart home adjusting temperature based on your routine.
