What is Generative AI?
Generative AI (Gen AI) = type of AI algorithm that can generate new outputs based on the data it has been trained on.
It doesn’t just analyze data — it creates new content such as text, images, audio, or video.
Example: ChatGPT, DALL·E, Midjourney, Suno AI.

What Generative AI Models Can Do
Create new content (text, art, audio, video).
Classify data and understand context.
Recognize patterns, images, or speech.

Language Components of Generative AI

NLP – Natural Language Processing
Helps machines understand and interpret human language.
Example: Sentiment analysis, translation, chatbots.

NLG – Natural Language Generation
Enables machines to generate meaningful text or speech in human-like ways.
Example: AI writing assistants, content generators.

LLM – Large Language Models
Advanced AI models trained on massive text datasets.
Can summarize, read, and generate text in a human-like manner.
Example: GPT-4, Gemini, Claude.

Types of Generative AI

Text-based
Generates text (stories, summaries, code, captions).
Example: ChatGPT, Jasper AI.

Text-to-Image
Converts written prompts into images.
Example: DALL·E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion.

Audio Generation
Creates or clones sounds and voices.
Example: Suno, ElevenLabs, MusicLM.

Video Generation
Produces or edits video content from text or image input.
Example: Pika Labs, Runway ML.
